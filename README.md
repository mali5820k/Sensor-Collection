# Sensor-Collection
##CS 321 Group Repository
- The Sensor-Collection group is responsible for data collection through sensor
operation. All sensor data will be outputted to a JSON file for interfacing
with other teams for both communication and fault management. The API will be
written in C, however, if a scenario arises where another team needs a set of
commands to be written in Python, we can accomodate that with a Python to C
caller script.

##Licensing
- All the repos that we are using are going to be open-source.
